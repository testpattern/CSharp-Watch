## CSharp-Watch ##

Watches the current directory and sub-directories for changes to C-Sharp files; initiating a build of the project to which the changed file belongs.

All you need is the .psm1 file. Download it and save to a new directory in your PowerShell modules directory, e.g.
`c:\users\you\documents\windowspowershell\modules\CSharp-Watch\`

Or, download from [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/CSharp-Watch/1.0).
